Lemmatization is a method which works similar as stemming but lemmatization always returns the root words which has meaning.\n","Lemmatization is slower than stemming because lemmatization again searches for root words with meaning whereas stemming doesn't always care about the meaning of the root word. So if you have to show the output to the user so meaningfulness is important is that case so lemmatization is used here. And if you don't have to show output to the user and you are concerned with the speed then you should use stemming.**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b8bd8d96","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.016215,"end_time":"2023-12-27T07:35:14.321219","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-12-27T07:35:14.305004","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Step 11: Lemmatization"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":34,"id":"73a760ce","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-27T07:35:14.356758Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-27T07:35:14.356339Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-27T07:35:15.228072Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-27T07:35:15.226174Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.893983,"end_time":"2023-12-27T07:35:15.231924","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-12-27T07:35:14.337941","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Word            Lemma          \n","The             the            \n","cats            cat            \n","are             be             \n","running         run            \n","and             and            \n","jumping         jump           \n","on              on             \n","the             the            \n","roof            roof           \n",".               .              \n"]}],"source":["nlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n","sentence = \"The cats are running and jumping on the roof.\"\n","doc = nlp(sentence)\n","print(\"{0:15} {1:15}\".format(\"Word\", \"Lemma\"))\n","for token in doc:\n","    print(\"{0:15} {1:15}\".format(token.text, token.lemma_))\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"73959ff8","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.01643,"end_time":"2023-12-27T07:35:15.266424","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-12-27T07:35:15.249994","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<div style=\"background-color:black; color:white; padding:20px; font-size:24px; font-weight:bold; text-align:left; border-radius:70px;\"> \n","      If this notebook helps, please consider UPVOTING.This inspires me a lot 😊 \n","</div>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cdb4621f","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.016224,"end_time":"2023-12-27T07:35:15.299336","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-12-27T07:35:15.283112","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["Check out my previous works:\n","* [NLP tutorial 1: A detailed introduction to NLP](https://www.kaggle.com/code/faizulislam19095/a-detailed-introduction-to-nlp)\n","* [Lung Cancer Prediction- EDA+SMOTE+ML modeling](https://www.kaggle.com/code/faizulislam19095/lung-cancer-prediction-eda-smote-modeling)"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"datasetId":134715,"sourceId":320111,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30626,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.12"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":19.819381,"end_time":"2023-12-27T07:35:16.842811","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2023-12-27T07:34:57.02343","version":"2.4.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
